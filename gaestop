Why you would use this:
- you need to stop an instance of Google App Engine

This can be done via the GCP UI, however during various deployments, noticed behavior where even though the instance is stopped, it was still firing code. 

To do this from terminal (either Google Cloud terminal, local terminal or in VS Code)

Verify where you are pointing:
gcloud config list project

Let's see what versions GCP is showing with the following command:
gcloud app versions
this will output all versions and version IDs under this instance - and it will show you which are "stopped" and "serving"

Now, let's stop the "serving" version:
gclooud app version stop <version id>

It will prompt you with a Y/n

After terminal confirms it's done, refresh your browser in app engine and you will see it is no longer serving traffic

**Important to note**
GAE automatically deploys a Google Cloud Storage bucket associated with your project 
This is part of the low-code infrastructure solution, otherwise we'd have to spin up Kubernetes buckets and manage this on our own. It's part of what we pay for and their services.
Don't delete the bucket if you see it in GCS. 
It will look like something like this: us.artifacts.projectname.appspot.com
