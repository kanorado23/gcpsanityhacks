- Why would you use this:
    - Verify that the Node app is still running / sanity check
    - Cloud Logging at times doesn’t give the same output that we want to see (yes it is possible and available, this is not included in this document)
    - To be able to see more detailed logs, with current state code base that's up in the VM
    - If App Engine Cron Job says it fails and you are looking to validate or verify it
- Log into to Google Cloud 
- Select the google project you are looking at
- Go to App Engine
- Then go to Versions
- Logs
    - Logging output
- Source
    - This will take you to the actual source code
    - To note >> This is different than Google Source Repositories 
- Config:
    - What the AppEngine is provisioned to
        - Use Standard
        - Flexible - is not flexible
            -Standard gives us the ability to control the instance. Flexible will automatically spin up additional instances to meet the demand. For deployments, we are using Standard intentionally to control the flow of API calls due to rate-limiting by external SaaS products
- Let’s say we are interested in validating the last time the cron ran. 
    - Open the following google service: App Engine Cron Jobs
    - You can hit “run” from this point and it will automatically run the codebase
    - Then, the results show “fail” - validate the failure
- Open up a google cloud terminal (>icon on the top right)
    - This will provision a terminal for you to work with. You can do the same thing in VS code or in Terminal however you need to install the Google Cloud SDK which with Apple's BigSur it's become quite parsnickity. 
    - First -- Confirm that this is pointing to the Google Cloud Project you are interested in with the following command:
        - Gcloud config list project
            - If it’s not pointing to the project you are interested in then type in the following:
            - Gcloud config set project <projectname>
        - After verifying you are pointing to the correct project with the AppEngine instance you are looking to debug / validate, run the following command in the terminal:
            - gcloud app logs tail -s default
            - this will show logging output of the code base (assuming there's logging baked into the code that was deployed up to GAE)
