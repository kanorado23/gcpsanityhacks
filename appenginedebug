- Why would you use this:
    - Verify that the Node app is still running / sanity check
    - Cloud Logging at times doesn’t give the same output that we want to see (yes it is possible and available, this is not included in this document)
    - To be able to see more detailed logs, with current state code base that's up in the VM
    - If App Engine Cron Job says it fails and you are looking to validate or verify it
- Log into to Google Cloud 
- Select the google project you are looking at
- Go to App Engine
- Then go to Versions
- Logs
    - Logging output
- Source
    - This will take you to the actual source code
    - To note >> This is different than Google Source Repositories 
- Config:
    - What the AppEngine is provisioned to
        - Use Standard
        - Flexible - is not flexible
- Let’s say we are interested in validating the last time the cron ran. 
    - Open the following google service: App Engine Cron Jobs
    - You can hit “run” from this point and it will automatically run the codebase
    - Then, the results show “fail” - validate the failure
- Open up a google cloud terminal (>icon on the top right)
    - This will provision a terminal for your
    - Confirm that this is pointing to the Google Cloud Project you are interested in
    - Gcloud config list project
        - If it’s not pointing to the project you are interested in then type in the following:
        - Gcloud config set project <projectname>
    - After verifying you are pointing to the correct project with the AppEngine instance you are looking to debug / validate, run the following command in the terminal:
        - gcloud app logs tail -s default
        - this will show logging output of the code base
